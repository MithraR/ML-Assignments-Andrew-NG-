Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n\nAll the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n\nBefore we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.\n\nYou can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments).","metadata":{"cell_id":"00000-f86dad52-95bc-4752-914c-73e3ce29c312","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00001-60c5603a-cfc3-4714-989e-19165caffbac","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"c8cf2669","execution_millis":1,"execution_start":1604679250765},"source":"# used for manipulating directory paths\nimport os\n\n# Scientific and vector computation for python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Plotting library\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D  # needed to plot 3-D surfaces\n\n# library written for this exercise providing additional functions for assignment submission, and others\nimport utils \n\n# define the submission/grader object for this exercise\ngrader = utils.Grader()\n\n# tells matplotlib to embed plots within the notebook\n%matplotlib inline","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Submission and Grading\n\nAfter completing each part of the assignment, be sure to submit your solutions to the grader.\n\nFor this programming exercise, you are only required to complete the first part of the exercise to implement linear regression with one variable.

They must also be re-executed everytime the submitted function is updated.\n</div>\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind throughout this exercise:\n\n- Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to OCTAVE/MATLAB). \n\n- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n\n- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n\n- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy`. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5).","metadata":{"cell_id":"00002-0458cf74-ab8d-4ed7-a1f1-b4fca824c6a9","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section1\"></a>\n## 1 Simple python and `numpy` function\n\nThe first part of this assignment gives you practice with python and `numpy` syntax and the homework submission process.

You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next. \n\nThe file `Data/ex1data1.txt` contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city (in 10,000s) and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city (in $10,000s).

For this dataset, you can use a scatter plot to visualize the data, since it has only two properties to plot (profit and population). Many other problems that you will encounter in real life are multi-dimensional and cannot be plotted on a 2-d plot. There are many plotting libraries in python (see this [blog post](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries/) for a good summary of the most popular ones). \n\nIn this course, we will be exclusively using `matplotlib` to do all our plotting. `matplotlib` is one of the most popular scientific plotting libraries in python and has extensive tools and functions to make beautiful plots. `pyplot` is a module within `matplotlib` which provides a simplified interface to `matplotlib`'s most common plotting tasks, mimicking MATLAB's plotting interface.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\nYou might have noticed that we have imported the `pyplot` module at the beginning of this exercise using the command `from matplotlib import pyplot`. This is rather uncommon, and if you look at python code elsewhere or in the `matplotlib` tutorials, you will see that the module is named `plt`. This is used by module renaming by using the import command `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. We will not using the short name of `pyplot` module in this class exercises, but you should be aware of this deviation from norm.\n</div>\n\n\nIn the following part, your first job is to complete the `plotData` function below.

That is, we minimize the value of $J(\\theta)$ by changing the values of the vector $\\theta$, not by changing $X$ or $y$. [Refer to the equations in this notebook](#section2) and to the video lectures if you are uncertain. A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look at the value of $J(\\theta)$ and check that it is decreasing with each step. \n\nThe starter code for the function `gradientDescent` calls `computeCost` on every iteration and saves the cost to a `python` list. Assuming you have implemented gradient descent and `computeCost` correctly, your value of $J(\\theta)$ should never increase, and should converge to a steady value by the end of the algorithm.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-box alert-warning\">\n**Vectors and matrices in `numpy`** - Important implementation notes\n\nA vector in `numpy` is a one dimensional array, for example `np.array([1, 2, 3])` is a vector. A matrix in `numpy` is a two dimensional array, for example `np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])`. However, the following is still considered a matrix `np.array([[1, 2, 3]])` since it has two dimensions, even if it has a shape of 1x3 (which looks like a vector).\n\nGiven the above, the function `np.dot` which we will use for all matrix/vector multiplication has the following properties:\n- It always performs inner products on vectors. If `x=np.array([1, 2, 3])`, then `np.dot(x, x)` is a scalar.\n- For matrix-vector multiplication, so if $X$ is a $m\\times n$ matrix and $y$ is a vector of length $m$, then the operation `np.dot(y, X)` considers $y$ as a $1 \\times m$ vector. On the other hand, if $y$ is a vector of length $n$, then the operation `np.dot(X, y)` considers $y$ as a $n \\times 1$ vector.\n- A vector can be promoted to a matrix using `y[None]` or `[y[np.newaxis]`. That is, if `y = np.array([1, 2, 3])` is a vector of size 3, then `y[None, :]` is a matrix of shape $1 \\times 3$. We can use `y[:, None]` to obtain a shape of $3 \\times 1$.\n<div>\n<a id=\"gradientDescent\"></a>","metadata":{"cell_id":"00025-ff5e6e2f-14ee-4c39-bbdd-a3b3bfc71b95","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00026-84ecf86e-7391-4592-81fe-049916fc76d0","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"8a33a9ee"},"source":"def gradientDescent(X, y, theta, alpha, num_iters):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs gradient descent to learn `theta`.

If you are an expert with matrix operations, you can prove to yourself that the two forms are equivalent.\n</div>\n\n<a id=\"computeCostMulti\"></a>","metadata":{"cell_id":"00047-21f00ebc-2d95-4748-848e-444f376a8a41","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00048-c976b543-985a-4de9-8f8c-4dded870a9e0","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"6f501b99"},"source":"def computeCostMulti(X, y, theta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute cost for linear regression with multiple variables.\n    Computes the cost of using theta as the parameter for linear regression to fit the data points in X and y.\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : array_like\n        The dataset of shape (m x n+1).\n    \n    y : array_like\n        A vector of shape (m, ) for the values at a given data point.\n    \n    theta : array_like\n        The linear regression parameters.

You can change the learning rate by modifying the following code and changing the part of the code that sets the learning rate.\n\nUse your implementation of `gradientDescentMulti` function and run gradient descent for about 50 iterations at the chosen learning rate. The function should also return the history of $J(\\theta)$ values in a vector $J$.\n\nAfter the last iteration, plot the J values against the number of the iterations.\n\nIf you picked a learning rate within a good range, your plot look similar as the following Figure. \n\n![](Figures/learning_rate.png)\n\nIf your graph looks very different, especially if your value of $J(\\theta)$ increases or even blows up, adjust your learning rate and try again. We recommend trying values of the learning rate $\\alpha$ on a log-scale, at multiplicative steps of about 3 times the previous value (i.e., 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and so on). You may also want to adjust the number of iterations you are running if that will help you see the overall trend in the curve.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n**Implementation Note:** If your learning rate is too large, $J(\\theta)$ can diverge and ‘blow up’, resulting in values which are too large for computer calculations. In these situations, `numpy` will tend to return\nNaNs. NaN stands for ‘not a number’ and is often caused by undefined operations that involve −∞ and +∞.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n**MATPLOTLIB tip:** To compare how different learning learning rates affect convergence, it is helpful to plot $J$ for several learning rates on the same figure. This can be done by making `alpha` a python list, and looping across the values within this list, and calling the plot function in every iteration of the loop. It is also useful to have a legend to distinguish the different lines within the plot. Search online for `pyplot.legend` for help on showing legends in `matplotlib`.\n</div>\n\nNotice the changes in the convergence curves as the learning rate changes. With a small learning rate, you should find that gradient descent takes a very long time to converge to the optimal value. Conversely, with a large learning rate, gradient descent might not converge or might even diverge!\nUsing the best learning rate that you found, run the script\nto run gradient descent until convergence to find the final values of $\\theta$. Next,\nuse this value of $\\theta$ to predict the price of a house with 1650 square feet and\n3 bedrooms. You will use value later to check your implementation of the normal equations. Don’t forget to normalize your features when you make this prediction!","metadata":{"cell_id":"00055-fcdee26b-c4a3-49e9-ba7d-e5ce80493a2f","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00056-6f690a0b-6cc4-45b5-aa41-1b07fdd34637","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"aad69662"},"source":"\"\"\"\nInstructions\n------------\nWe have provided you with the following starter code that runs\ngradient descent with a particular learning rate (alpha). \n\nYour task is to first make sure that your functions - `computeCost`\nand `gradientDescent` already work with  this starter code and\nsupport multiple variables.\n\nAfter that, try running gradient descent with different values of\nalpha and see which one gives you the best result.\n\nFinally, you should complete the code at the end to predict the price\nof a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house.\n\nHint\n----\nAt prediction, make sure you do the same feature normalization.\n\"\"\"\n# Choose some alpha value - change this\nalpha = 0.1\nnum_iters = 400\n\n# init theta and run gradient descent\ntheta = np.zeros(3)\ntheta, J_history = gradientDescentMulti(X, y, theta, alpha, num_iters)\n\n# Plot the convergence graph\npyplot.plot(np.arange(len(J_history)), J_history, lw=2)\npyplot.xlabel('Number of iterations')\npyplot.ylabel('Cost J')\n\n# Display the gradient descent's result\nprint('theta computed from gradient descent: {:s}'.format(str(theta)))\n\n# Estimate the price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house\n# ======================= YOUR CODE HERE ===========================\n# Recall that the first column of X is all-ones. \n# Thus, it does not need to be normalized.\n\nprice = 0   # You should change this\n\n# ===================================================================\n\nprint('Predicted price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house (using gradient descent): ${:.0f}'.format(price))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*You do not need to submit any solutions for this optional (ungraded) part.*","metadata":{"cell_id":"00057-ebe44dbf-9fab-46bc-8da8-229fedbab833","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section7\"></a>\n### 3.3 Normal Equations\n\nIn the lecture videos, you learned that the closed-form solution to linear regression is\n\n$$ \\theta = \\left( X^T X\\right)^{-1} X^T\\vec{y}$$\n\nUsing this formula does not require any feature scaling, and you will get an exact solution in one calculation: there is no “loop until convergence” like in gradient descent. \n\nFirst, we will reload the data to ensure that the variables have not been modified.
